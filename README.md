Hand Mini Bar - a mini toolbar for FoundryVTT to display a hand of cards

## What?

A module to display a players hand of cards on the FoundryVTT game screen in a small toolbar

## Usage

Enable the module.

![Toolbar Start](artwork/tutorial-start.png?raw=true)

The Module will display a single hand toolbar in the bottom left corner by default. Clicking the gear icon 'âš™' will allow the user to select from the list of hands they have permission to use.

![Toolbar Cards](artwork/tutorial-cards.png?raw=true)

The toolbar has buttons to `draw cards`, `pass cards`, or `show hand` window. Left Clicking a card will pull up the play card dialog. Right click will flip the card to it's back. Dragging and dropping can be used to drop cards between toolbars or back and forth from the deck/hand/pile windows. If the hand is in the way the arrow at the bottom will hide/show all the hands displayed.

![Settings Panel](artwork/tutorial-settings.png?raw=true)

Advanced options are available to display up to 10 hands and their titles making the module more useful for a DM to track everyones hands.

By Default the toolbar disables messages to chat. This can be re-enabled in the module settings. Also included is a better message when playing the card which includes the image, title and description.

## Why?

There wasn't a module (that I knew of) in Foundry to display a hand of cards on the screen in a way that was concise and easy to use.

## Backstory

The project came out of a need in our Deadlands campaign to display multi colored tokens (Bennys) instead of the single colored ones provided by the SWADE System. The new cards feature is the perfect framework for pulling tokens out of a bag at random. Using the card system also allows the module to be used for keeping track of anything in a tabletop game that a player needs to keep track of (e.g. Hero Points).
