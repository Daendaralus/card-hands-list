# Card Hands List

Card Hands List is a system-agnostic module for Foundry VTT that provides quick access to Card Hands the user owns. The module adds a collapsible list of Card Hands placed above the Players List, blending in with the core Foundry VTT UI.

## Features

- Automatic population of all Card Hands the user owns.
- A setting to include Card Hands for which the user has at least Observer ownership.
- A button to directly draw Cards to the respective Card Hand.
- A button to "favorite" a Card Hand to always display it even when the Card Hands List UI is collapsed.
- Drag and drop Cards within a Card Hand to reorder them, or drag a Card to another Card Hand in the list to pass the Card.
- Right-click on a Card to flip it.
