# Adventure Cards Hand Toolbar for FoundryVTT

A fork of the Hand Mini Bar (HMB) module for FoundryVTT completely reconfigured and redesigned to work specifically with the official Savage Worlds Adventure Deck module.
Please note that the Adventure Deck module is required to activate this module.

## What?

This module is designed to display Adventure Card hands on the FoundryVTT game screen in a small toolbar. Users can add multiple hands to easily see and share cards among other players.

## Usage

The Module will display a single hand toolbar on the right side of the macro bar by default. Clicking on the empty bar will prompt for selecting a hand to display in that bar.

Above the toolbars is a shortcut to the discard pile storing the played Adventure Cards.

After the bar is populated, buttons for drawing an Adventure Card or reconfiguring the toolbar will appear.

If the toolbars are in the way, the arrow at the bottom will toggle the visibility of all hands.

Clicking on the hand will open it using the official Adventure Cards sheet.

### Position Selection

Selecting position will change the location for all users. Currently three options to positions along the bottom of the screen.

## Why?

The original HMB module is a fantastic tool for broader use of cards in many games, but the official Savage Worlds Adventure Deck module has specific interactions that were cumbersome when combined with HMB's custom interctions. This version simplifies and minimizes a lot of the interactions and behaviors.
