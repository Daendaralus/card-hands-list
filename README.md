# Card Hands List

Cards Hands List is a system-agnostic module for Foundry VTT that provides quick access to Card Hands to which the user has full ownership. The module adds a collapsible list of card hands placed above the Players List, blending in with the core Foundry VTT UI.

## Features

- Automatic population of all hands the user owns.
- A setting to include card hands for which the user has at least Observer ownership.
- A button to directly draw cards to the respective hand.
- A button to "favorite" a hand to always display it even when the Card Hands List UI is collapsed.
- Drag and drop cards within a hand to reorder them, or drag a card to another hand in the list to pass the card.
- Right-click on a card to flip it.
